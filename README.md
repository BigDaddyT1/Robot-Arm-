# Robot Arm
#What is this Project?
Build a robot arm that can do a task.
## Requirements (read this)
-Your robot arm can pick something up or hold something, and move it around.  This is very general, and should be made more specific, based on the particular problem that you're attempting to solve.
-Your robot arm's motion should have 3-6 servos Micro or standard. 
-This robot arm is controlled with Arduino or CircuitPython, your choice.  The controller should run off either power coming from USB or a rechargeable 9V battery or battery pack.
-Like all of your prior projects, there should be an easy way to switch off the power, an easy way to change batteries, and some obvious indication when power is on.
-Knock out your design in CAD before you start constructing anything.  Use SolidWorks to do a motion and/or stress analysis of your robot arm or some part of the arm.

#Our goal/ Vission:
What we wanted to do as a team is create a solution to our problem. Our problem being how can we get extra practice when we dont have other people who want to come out and get extra practice. Our solition: create a robot arm that can be used as a multi-purpouse tool and can be there when the person is not.This is why we chose to make a robot arm that can throw baseballs and give you infeild repetitions when you need. Making this will eliminate the need for another person to be there and will help give you the perfect reps every time.
